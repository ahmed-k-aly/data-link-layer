People often install a kitty door, only to discover that they have a problem. The problem is their cat will not use the kitty door. There are several common reasons why cats wont use kitty doors. First, they may not understand how a kitty door works. They may not understand that it is a little doorway just for them. Second, many kitty doors are dark, and cats cannot see to the other side. As such, they cant be sure of what is on the other side of the door, so they wont take the risk. One last reason cats wont use kitty doors is because some cats dont like the feeling of pushing through the door and having the door drag across their back. But dont worry -- there is a solution for this kitty-door problem.
